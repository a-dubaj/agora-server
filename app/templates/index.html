Ahoy, matey!<br />
<br />
This is the <strong>Agora v0.5.1</strong>.<br />
<br />
This site is very much under construction, but feel free to look around: 
<ul>
	<li><a href="{{nodes}}">{{nodes}}</a> lists all nodes in this Agora; a node is the set of all subnodes with a given title, or otherwise about the same entity. Subnodes can come from a variety of sources.</li>
	<li><a href="{{subnodes}}">{{subnodes}}</a> lists all subnodes in this Agora; currently these are mostly notes as volunteered by users.</li>
	<li><a href="{{journals}}">{{journals}}</a> displays all journal entries (these are notes matching YYYY-MM-DD).</li>
	<li><a href="{{users}}">{{users}}</a> displays all users in this Agora, click through to see their subnodes.</li>
	<li><a href="{{search}}">{{search}}</a> offers full text search over all subnodes (supports regexes).</li>
</ul>

The <a href="/node/wikilink">[[wikilink]]</a> is the heart of the Agora. <a href="/node/foo">/node/foo</a> will render every subnode that resolves to wikilink <a href="/node/foo">[[foo]]</a>. For example: <a href="/node/agora">[[Agora]]</a>.

<br /><br />
